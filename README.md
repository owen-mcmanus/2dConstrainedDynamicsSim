# 2D Constrained Dynamics Solver/Simulator (WIP)

Simulates real world physical systems by describing the system as a series of springs.
Forces are then applied to these spring to cause them to obay physical constrants while still responding to the normal laws of physics.
For example, to form a solid bar, and expansion force is added to oppose the contraction force of the spring, keeping the two endpoints an equal distance apart.
